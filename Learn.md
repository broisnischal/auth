OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect (OIDC) Advanced Flows
PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange): Used for securing OAuth authorization code flow, especially in public clients like SPAs and mobile apps.
JWT Introspection: Validating tokens by querying the authorization server for their status, typically used for long-lived tokens.
Token Exchange: Using the OAuth 2.0 token exchange extension to swap one token for another.
OIDC Hybrid Flow: Combining features of both the implicit and authorization code flow for more flexible authentication.

OAuth 2.1: Understand the refinements and security updates coming in OAuth 2.1. 2. Federated Identity Management
SAML 2.0: Understanding Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) used in enterprise environments for Single Sign-On (SSO) between identity providers (IdP) and service providers (SP).
Shibboleth: Open-source implementation for federated identity management, typically used in academic or governmental institutions.
Identity Brokering: Using a single platform (like Keycloak, Auth0, etc.) to manage multiple identity providers (Google, Facebook, SAML, etc.) and centralize access control. 3. FIDO2 / WebAuthn
Passwordless Authentication: Advanced knowledge of FIDO2 (Fast Identity Online) and WebAuthn for biometric and hardware-based authentication, moving towards passwordless login experiences.
U2F (Universal 2nd Factor): Understanding the use of physical devices like security keys for 2FA (hardware-based token authentication). 4. Delegated Authorization
ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control): Defining access control based on user attributes, resource attributes, and environment conditions.
PBAC (Policy-Based Access Control): Implementing policies that dictate user privileges based on business logic or regulatory compliance.
Context-Aware Security: Enhancing RBAC or ABAC by factoring in environmental elements such as user location, time, or device fingerprint for authentication. 5. Token Best Practices
Refresh Token Revocation: Understanding when and how to revoke refresh tokens in complex systems, and managing short-lived access tokens.
Access Token Scopes & Permissions: Designing token scopes in a secure way for microservices to limit access to only what is necessary.
Token Caching & Validation Optimization: Performance optimization techniques for token validation, especially in distributed systems where latency is critical (caching, introspection, etc.). 6. Advanced Security Patterns
Zero Trust Security: Understanding the shift towards zero trust security models where no user or system is inherently trusted, even if inside the perimeter.
Just-in-Time Access: Granting users permissions only when needed and for the shortest possible duration, with continuous monitoring.
Mutual TLS (mTLS): Implementing client certificate-based authentication to authenticate both client and server in network communications. 7. Authentication in Microservices
Service-to-Service Authentication: Using tokens (JWT, MTLS, or OAuth) for securing communication between microservices.
Distributed Session Management: Handling session state in distributed environments with techniques like token-based authentication or sticky sessions in a clustered environment.
Perimeter and In-Service Authentication: Employing API gateways (e.g., Kong, Envoy) for authentication at the edge while enforcing further authentication checks within individual services. 8. API Security
OAuth 2.0 for Machine-to-Machine Authentication: Handling API clients securely with OAuth's client credentials flow, limiting scope and privileges.
HMAC Signatures: Using keyed-hash message authentication codes for verifying API requests, especially in environments where OAuth might not fit.
Rate-Limiting and Throttling for Authentication: Applying rate-limits and throttling mechanisms at the authentication layer to mitigate brute-force and DOS attacks. 9. Session Management in Advanced Scenarios
Sliding Session Expiration: Extending session lifetime dynamically based on user activity to balance security and usability.
Session Fixation Attacks Prevention: Ensuring session IDs are invalidated and new ones issued after a user logs in to prevent session fixation attacks. 10. Authorization Frameworks
OAuth Resource Server / API Gateway Authorization: How API gateways (Kong, AWS API Gateway, NGINX) and OAuth work together to authorize incoming requests.
OPA (Open Policy Agent): Implementing fine-grained, context-driven access control policies using policy-as-code.
Cognito & Identity Pools: Working with AWS Cognito to manage user identity and access permissions across AWS resources. 11. Identity Proofing and User Verification
KYC (Know Your Customer): Integrating third-party services for identity proofing, e.g., via national IDs, passports, etc.
Identity Verification: Best practices for integrating services like Jumio, Onfido for verifying the authenticity of user-provided documents during registration. 12. Audit Logs & Compliance
Audit Trails for Authentication Events: Logging all authentication, authorization, and token-related actions for auditing, forensics, and compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS).
GDPR, CCPA Compliance: Handling authentication and identity data in a way that ensures compliance with privacy regulations, including right-to-access, right-to-forget, and data anonymization. 13. Advanced MFA Techniques
Adaptive/Conditional MFA: Implementing MFA based on risk scoring and user behavior (e.g., enforcing MFA if login is from an unfamiliar location).
Social Login with MFA: Combining social login (Google, Facebook, etc.) with additional MFA (TOTP, SMS, email OTP). 14. Threat Modeling for Authentication
Authentication Threat Models: Understanding and mitigating threats such as session hijacking, token replay attacks, CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), and brute force attacks on passwords.
Credential Stuffing Mitigation: Implementing solutions like CAPTCHA, rate-limiting, and password-less authentication to mitigate automated attacks using stolen credentials. 15. Emerging Authentication Technologies
Decentralized Identity (DID): Understanding how distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) like blockchain can be used for self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems.
Verifiable Credentials: Exploring W3Câ€™s verifiable credentials standard, used to create digital certificates that can be cryptographically verified across decentralized networks.
